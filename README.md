My submission for pocket devs assignment

Ecommerce fashion

I cloned the Squarespace template, Alameda as submission to showcase my skills. Reason being that, having gone through the projects on pocket devs website, there are so many projects that are e-commerce based and I could use this to show my frontend building skills in that area.
