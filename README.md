### Chosen Industry

Ecommerce fashion

I cloned the Squarespace template, Alameda as submission to showcase my skills. Reason being that, having gone through the projects on pocket devs website, there are so many projects that are e-commerce based, and I could show my skills in that area.

### Tech Stack

- Redux (for global state management)
- NextJS (React Framework)
- Tailwind CSS (for styling)
